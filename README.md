# Basic NFT Minter

## Project Description
The Basic NFT Minter is a Soroban smart contract that allows users to mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with a name and metadata URI. Each NFT is associated with a unique ID and an owner's wallet address. This contract provides simple functions to mint, retrieve, and track NFTs.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to provide an easy-to-use and lightweight NFT minting solution for decentralized applications on the Stellar blockchain using Soroban. This contract can serve as a foundational component for more complex NFT marketplaces or collectible platforms.

## Key Features

- 🔍 **View NFT Info:** Fetch details of a minted NFT using its ID.
- 📊 **Track Supply:** Query total number of NFTs minted.

## Future Scope
